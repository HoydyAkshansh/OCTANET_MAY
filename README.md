OctaNet Software Services - TO DO List

Welcome to OctaNet Software Services' TO DO List repository. This repository is dedicated to managing and organizing tasks related to our website projects. The TO DO List feature allows us to create, categorize, prioritize, and monitor tasks effectively, ensuring a streamlined workflow and timely project completion.

Features

Task Creation and Categorization: Create tasks and categorize them based on different website projects or functionalities.
Priority and Deadline Assignment: Assign priorities (high, medium, low) and deadlines to tasks for better organization and urgency management.
Labels for Clarity: Use labels to categorize tasks by type (e.g., frontend, backend, design) or any custom category that suits our project needs.
